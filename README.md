# Myelinated Axon Model

Simulation of the myelinated axon by Lee Cossell and David Attwell. Includes adaptations to include Juxtaparanodes (for cortical axons) and their associated K+ channels as part of my Master's Thesis Research.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the model you will need MATLAB. This model and the associated GUI have been tried using the following combinations:

* MATLAB R2013b running on Windows 7   
* MATLAB R2016a running on OSX El Capitan   

### Installing

Clone or copy the directory to any location. Add the directory to the MATLAB path, or, at the MATLAB command prompt run:

```
>>Setup()
```

which will add the directory to the user's MATLAB path (after asking) and open the GUI.

### JPN Modifications

The code necessary to run the simulations in the Master's Thesis is found in the "JPN_Implementation" folder. To reproduce the figures in the Thesis, check the code in the "Figures" subfolder
